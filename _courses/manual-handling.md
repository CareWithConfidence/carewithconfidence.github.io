Manual handling accidents account for more than a third of all accidents reported each year to the enforcing authorities. It is estimated that in excess of 500,000 people in Great Britain suffer from a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) mainly affecting the upper limbs or neck that was caused, or made worse, by their current or past work.


This Manual Handling Training Course provides the necessary information and training for organisations to understand more about the risks associated with manual handling, how to undergo a risk assessment and how to ensure appropriate control measures are put in place.
